# Getting Started with <%= project_name %>

<!--
**Early development?** Leave this mostly empty. Claude will use `.context/` from your gems.

**Patterns stabilized?** Fill in non-obvious gotchas and project-specific information.

See `context/guides/writing-context.md` for the full system (skills+hooks+dev-docs).

## What is <%= project_name %>?

[1-2 sentences: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?]

## Setting Up for Success

**Priority 1: Skills + Hooks** - This is where the biggest gains come from. See `context/guides/writing-context.md` for the full system.

1. Create domain-specific skills in `.claude/skills/local/`
2. Set up `skill-rules.json` with keywords and file patterns
3. Copy skill-activator hook from `.context/claude-arsenal/hooks/`
4. Result: Skills that actually auto-activate, patterns stay consistent

**Priority 2: Dev Docs Workflow** - For large features, prevents context loss.

1. Copy `/dev-docs` and `/create-dev-docs` commands
2. For each large task: plan → create dev docs → implement → update before compaction
3. Result: Claude never loses the plot, even through multiple compactions

**Priority 3: Fill In This Context** - Only after patterns stabilize.

## Setup Requirements

### Credentials & Authentication

<!-- Only document if YOUR project needs special auth -->

[If this project requires API keys, tokens, or special authentication, explain how to obtain them and where they go]

### External Dependencies

<!-- Only document if YOUR project integrates with external services -->

[If this integrates with external APIs, databases, or services, document the connection points]

## Project-Specific Setup Gotchas

<!-- This is the *most valuable* section - document the non-obvious stuff -->

### [Gotcha 1]

**Issue**: [What goes wrong if you don't know this]

**Why**: [The non-obvious reason]

**Solution**: [How to handle it]

## Quick Commands

<!-- *Only* if your project has non-standard or custom commands -->

```bash
# Custom command specific to this project
[command]  # What it does and why you'd use it

# Another project-specific command
[command]  # What it does and why you'd use it
```

## Development Modes

<!-- *Only* if your project has special modes (dev, staging, prod with different behaviors) -->

[Explain any project-specific development modes or environment-specific behaviors]

## Integration Points
