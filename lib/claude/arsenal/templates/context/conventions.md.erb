# Conventions

<!--
Only document things that DIFFER from standard conventions.

If you follow standards, this file should be mostly empty!

See `context/guides/writing-context.md` for guidance.

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Naming Patterns

<!-- *Only* include if you have project-specific naming beyond standard conventions -->

[Example: "All API client classes must end with 'Client' (e.g., AccountClient, OrderClient)"]

[Example: "Database models use singular nouns (User, not Users) to match ActiveRecord"]

### Code Organization

<!-- *Only* if you have unusual organization -->

[Example: "Controllers go in app/http/ not app/controllers/ because we separate HTTP from other interfaces"]

[Example: "All external API integrations must be in lib/integrations/ with adapters"]

## Project-Specific Restrictions

<!-- Document things you DON'T want Claude to do -->

**Don't use**: [Pattern/library/approach]

**Why**: [Reason for avoiding it]

**Use instead**: [Preferred approach]

---

**Example:**
- **Don't use**: Direct Prisma queries in controllers
- **Why**: We had data consistency issues in production
- **Use instead**: Repository pattern in lib/repositories/

## Domain-Specific Terminology

<!-- Map your project's terms to standard concepts -->

**[Your Term]** = [Standard equivalent]
- [When to use it, any nuances]

---

**Example:**
- **"Massive account"** = Account with >1000 users (not related to massive.com)
- **"Workflow state"** = State machine node (we use 'state' not 'node' in code)

## Testing Conventions

<!-- *Only* if you have unusual testing patterns -->

[Example: "All controller tests must use the test_auth_helper for authenticated requests"]

[Example: "Integration tests go in test/integration/, not test/ (differs from Minitest default)"]

## Documentation Conventions

<!-- *Only* if you have specific requirements -->

[Example: "All public API methods require YARD docs with @example blocks"]

[Example: "RBS signatures required for all public modules in lib/"]
