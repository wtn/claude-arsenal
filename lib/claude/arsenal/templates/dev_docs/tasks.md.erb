## Phase 1: Research & Design

- [ ] Analyze existing codebase for similar patterns
  - [ ] Find comparable implementations
  - [ ] Document patterns to follow
- [ ] Identify all affected components
  - [ ] List files that need modification
  - [ ] List new files to create
- [ ] Design data structures
- [ ] Design interfaces/APIs
- [ ] Document architectural decisions in context.md

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Create main implementation file
- [ ] Implement core business logic
  - [ ] [Specific feature 1]
  - [ ] [Specific feature 2]
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Define custom error types
  - [ ] Add error recovery logic
- [ ] Add logging/monitoring
- [ ] Write unit tests
  - [ ] Happy path tests
  - [ ] Error case tests
  - [ ] Edge case tests

## Phase 3: Integration

- [ ] Connect to existing [system/component]
- [ ] Update API endpoints
  - [ ] Add new routes
  - [ ] Update existing routes
- [ ] Database changes (if needed)
  - [ ] Create migration
  - [ ] Update models
- [ ] Update frontend (if needed)
  - [ ] Add UI components
  - [ ] Connect to backend
- [ ] Write integration tests

## Phase 4: Polish & Documentation

- [ ] Code review checklist
  - [ ] Remove debug code
  - [ ] Check for code smells
  - [ ] Ensure consistent naming
  - [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Notes

### Task Markings
- [>>] = In Progress
- [=>] = Up Next
- [x] = Complete
- [!] = Bug Fix
- [X] = Blocked
- [~] = Deferred

### Update Protocol
1. Mark tasks as [>>] when starting
2. Move completed tasks to Completed section
3. Update progress bar
4. Update Last Updated timestamp
5. Add discovered tasks to Additional Tasks section
