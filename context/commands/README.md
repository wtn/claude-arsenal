# Reference Slash Command Implementations

These are slash command definitions you can copy to your project.

## Available Commands

- **dev-docs.md** - Create comprehensive development documentation for features
- **code-review.md** - Run architectural code review on current changes
- **build-and-fix.md** - Run builds and fix any errors found

## Usage

Copy the command you need:

```bash
cp .context/claude-arsenal/commands/dev-docs.md .claude/commands/
```

The command becomes available as `/command-name` immediately.

## Customization

Customize commands to match your workflow:
- File templates and structure
- Checklist items
- Output locations
- Integration with your tools

## Why Copy?

Slash commands define workflows. While they're just Markdown prompts, they often need project-specific paths, file structures, and integration points.
